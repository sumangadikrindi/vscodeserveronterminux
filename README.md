# Run VS Code Tunnel on your android phone

## Do you like to use your Android phone's processing and memory for your development?

This script is for opening a VS Code tunnel running on pdistro-ubuntu in Termux app on Android phone.
This installs proot-distro ubuntu, and inside the proot-dristro it installs .net lts sdk, and vs code cli, and opens vs code tunnel.
